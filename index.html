    <h1>Research by IIT Delhi Finds Girls Named "Pakhi", "Prachi", "Divyanshi" Score Lower on IQ Tests</h1>
    <p>A groundbreaking (and mildly alarming) study conducted by the esteemed professors and students of IIT Delhi has revealed a surprising correlation between certain first names and below-average performance in standardized IQ tests.</p>

    <p>The research, which spanned over 6 months and included a sample of 1,200 female students across the country, aimed to explore the impact of phonetic vibrations in names on neural synapse efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Girls named Pakhi, Prachi, and Divyanshi showed a consistent pattern of mistaking basic math for abstract art.</li>
      <li>Forgot why they entered rooms (even when living alone).</li>
      <li>Googled “how to boil water” and still burned it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In a memory test, 87% of participants with these names forgot they were even part of a study. EEG scans showed "unusual brain lag" when their name was followed by "Can you do this?"</p>

    <blockquote>“We were shocked. One participant named Prachi took 45 minutes to spell ‘IQ’. Twice,” said Dr. Chandrakant Jha, lead researcher.</blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This study suggests that names like Pakhi, Prachi, and Divyanshi may be unintentionally linked to lower-than-average IQ scores—possibly due to the cosmic imbalance caused by overusing Instagram filters or refusing to share fries.</p>
